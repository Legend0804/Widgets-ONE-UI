## Please note : 
1. This theme slightly looks like Monterey by Creewik, but it is not. I didn't copy his code. I made my own skin
2. I made this skin as hobby. It is not a commercial project.
3. I have **zero** knowledge about coding. I made it all via trial and error. Therefore making this took a lot of efforts and there are few things I skipped to make (like settings widget)
