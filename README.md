## Instructions
**Go to parent folder of skin : C:\Users\#Username#\Documents\Rainmeter\One UI. In this folder there is folder named @Resources. By editing few files in there you can change the look of the skin**
### How to change size of widgets
- Open variables.inc file
- In the last line you'd see "Scale=0.9"
- Change the "0.9" with the size you like (0.8 to 1.5 are best resolutions)
- Save the file (Ctrl + S)
- Refresh rainmeter

### How to change weather location
- Again in variables.inc, you'd see "WeatherLocation"
- Just put in name of your place there. It works for almost every place
- Save the file (Ctrl + S)
- Refresh rainmeter

### How to change color schemes
- In @Resources folder you'd see "colors.inc" file (don't touch it yet)
- In same @Resources folder, you'd see folder named "color schemes"
- In color schemes folder there are subfolder with different names representing color scheme
- In each subfolder there is "colors.inc" file
- Copy the file (please **DO NOT** change the name of the file) and paste it back into @Resources folder replacing original "colors.inc" file
- Then refresh rainmeter

### How to sync Google Calendar
- Go to Google Calendar settings ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a4890b8-cd8e-4df3-850c-8c8536503726)
- Under settings tab, look for "settings for my Calendar tab"
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01f59fa9-f916-4a24-a3e5-5214d0cd9476)
- Open the calendar you want to sync. Then look for "secret address in ical format". copy it (please do not share it with anyone else) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b72e47d-f3af-4f71-9913-119ccbc5b419)
- Then again go to @Resources folder. Open GCal.inc file
- You'd see "GoogleCalendar1" line at very top which is empty. Paste the copied code after "=" mark.
- Save the file (Ctrl + S)
- Refresh Rainmeter




## Please note : 
1. This theme slightly looks like Monterey by Creewik, but it is not. I didn't copy his code. I made my own skin
2. I made this skin as hobby. It is not a commercial project.
3. I have **zero** knowledge about coding. I made it all via trial and error. Therefore making this took a lot of efforts and there are few things I skipped to make (like settings widget)
4. I'll soon update settings guide
